# Probability alghoritm
This alghorithm can analize a huge amounts of 3-arguments data and create the most closest (with manual settings) genetic-based data.
I used ML-elements and genetic programming.

1)You must use (x,y,result) format to input the data. It must be stored in .txt file

2)Alghoritm will generate random result for each data-line in file.

3)Then, it will mutate the data and select the closest to predicted result. You must input a few params to make result less or bigger to the input data.

4)Result will appear in .txt file.
